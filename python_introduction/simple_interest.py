# Define the variables for principal, rate, and time
principal = 1000  # Initial investment amount ($1000)
rate = 0.05       # Annual interest rate (5% as a decimal)
time = 3          # Time the money is invested for in years (3 years)

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest in the specified format
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
